"
1,"Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.
"
0,"The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.
"
1,"It doesn't make you look cool.
"
2,"Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.
"
3,"Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.
"
3,"Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.
"
2,"You can't beat the price on these.
"
2,"Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!
"
2,"lightweight and works well.
"
1,"So just beware.
"
0,"I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.

"
0,"This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!

"
1,"It was horrible!.
"
1,"I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.
"
